# EngUaConverter
Class that converts eng2ua or ua2eng (Wrong keyboard layout)

Since the time when I started learning programming, there was one thing.

Every time I forgot to switch the keyboard layout, I screamed and told myself that one day I would write a program that would convert the written line into the appropriate layout...

Ladies and gentlemen, meet my EngUaConverter class and an app build with UI on WindowsForms!
